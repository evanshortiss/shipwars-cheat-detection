## General Idea

Cheat detection for a video game by auditing the stream of
player transactions. This doesn't need to happen in real-time.
Just needs to be reasonably fast to ban players.




1. Simplicity. No Kafka necessarry! It's all HTTP baby!
2. Retain the benefits of event-driven architecure.
3. Effective resource utilisation. Scale down when not busy.
